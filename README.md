## Overview

Welcome to the **Crystal-Coding** repository! This project is a collection of my solutions to various LeetCode, GFG, Coding Ninja problems, solved as part of the **Coder Army DSA List** initiated by [Rohit Negi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohit-negi9/). The challenge is designed to help aspiring software engineers enhance their problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews. My main aim will be to simply explain the approach and code it out based on multiple ways for tackling the same question ensuring a crystal clear explaination for the same.

## Challenge Structure

The challenge consists of solving a curated list of DSA problems, covering a range of topics and difficulty levels. Each day focuses on different types of problems, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of data structures and algorithms.

### Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching
- Bit Manipulation
- And more...
